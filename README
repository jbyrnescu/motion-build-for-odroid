Join me at a meetup in Walnut Creek:

This site explains how to build and use motion for Odroid with the Linux operating system.
 
Prerequisites
In order to complete these instructions you must have an Odroid with some form of input to the device using either a monitor hooked up to the HDMI port, the usb cable hooked up to a terminal on another computer, or via the network (WiFi or Ethernet).  For more details on using the usb cable see the hardkernel website.  http://www.hardkernel.com
Step 1 - Download the Makefile
The Makefile is available at:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/motion-build-for-odroid/
run the make command on odroid with linux
> make all
This will download any libraries or programs needed to build motion and use them to make the motion program.
Step 2 - Download the scripts
There are 3 scripts in total.  There should be a directory structure of ./tmpDir/tmpDir where motion is started in the first level tmpDir and where all of the files generated by motion are stored.
 
Step 3 â€“ Use the scripts
One is findStartingJpgs.sh.  This depends on you being inside the first tmpDir where motion was started.  This script will copy the first few frames of the videos so they can be analyzed for deletion or further analysis.
 
The next script is cpUnrecognized.sh.  This script should be located in the second level tmpDir directory.  After the first stage of analysis, recognized .jpgs should be deleted.  The unrecognized .jpgs can then be used to gather more information using the .avi files generated.  These .avi files are then viewed to see what is in them.
 
Finally, when all of the image and movie files are analyzed use the rmAllMotionFiles.sh to clean up the directory for later use and synchronization with any activities you may have.
